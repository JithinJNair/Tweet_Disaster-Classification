    <h1>Disaster tweet-Classification</h1>
    <ol>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p1>
       Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
       The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. 
        Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and    news agencies).But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.
        With this data set, we are challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t.
